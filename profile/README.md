VPN companies have advertisements everywhere, there‚Äôs a reason they sponsor most tech YouTubers (they‚Äôve even tried it with me) but you don‚Äôt need to buy an expensive plan to use a VPN.

Here‚Äôs how you can build your own:

Step 1: Set Up the Server
For ease of use, a Linux server at your disposal would be ideal. On there, log in using SSH. If you don‚Äôt have one, services like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean offer free tiers that you can use for this purpose.



ssh username@server_ip


Replace ‚Äúusername‚Äù with the actual username you use to log into your server.

Replace ‚Äúserver_ip‚Äù with the IP address of your server. If you are using a cloud service, look in the server dashboard.

Step 2: Install OpenVPN and Easy-RSA
OpenVPN is going to be our free VPN solution and I will show you how it supports various encryption protocols. Let‚Äôs install it:



    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openvpn


Download Easy-RSA:



    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install easy-rsa


Step 3: Configuration
Generate the server‚Äôs certificates and keys:



    cd /usr/share/easy-rsa
    sudo ./easyrsa init-pki
    sudo ./easyrsa build-ca
    sudo ./easyrsa gen-req server nopass
    sudo ./easyrsa sign-req server server


During this process, when prompted, you will need to set a password and server username. Once signed, you should see this in the terminal:



Now the server is setup, generate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange:



    sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/openvpn/dh.pem 2048


Your terminal should look something like this:



Now you need to generate an HMAC signature for a strengthened control channel:



    sudo openvpn --genkey secret /etc/openvpn/ta.key


Step 4: Server Configuration
Create a server configuration file /etc/openvpn/server.conf and add the following lines:

port 1194
proto udp
dev tun
ca /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/ca.crt
cert /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/issued/server.crt
key /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/private/server.key
dh /etc/openvpn/dh.pem
tls-auth /etc/openvpn/ta.key 0
server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
ifconfig-pool-persist /etc/openvpn/ipp.txt
push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"
push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8"
user nobody
group nogroup
persist-key
persist-tun
status /var/log/openvpn-status.log
verb 3
You can write files in the Linux Terminal by utilising Nano:



    cd /etc/openvpn/
    sudo nano server.conf


Enter the configuration file lines:



Then press CTRL + O, ENTER, then CTRL + X and the file will be saved.

Step 5: Enable IP Forwarding
Uncomment the following line in /etc/sysctl.conf to enable IP forwarding:



Activate the changes:



    sudo sysctl -p


Step 6: Firewall Configuration
Configure the firewall to allow VPN traffic:



    sudo ufw allow 1194/udp
    sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
    sudo ufw enable


Step 7: Client Configuration
Generate client keys:



    cd /usr/share/easy-rsa
    sudo ./easyrsa gen-req client nopass
    sudo ./easyrsa sign-req client client


During this process, you will again enter the username and use ‚Äúuser‚Äù as a placeholder. Then, once prompted, type the word ‚Äòyes‚Äô and enter the password we used earlier in Step 3 for the server‚Äôs certificates and keys setup.

Lastly, create a client configuration file named client.ovpn in /etc/openvpn/ :

client
dev tun
proto udp
remote your_server_ip 1194
resolv-retry infinite
nobind
persist-key
persist-tun
key-direction 1
remote-cert-tls server
tls-auth ta.key 1
data-ciphers AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM
verb 3
Copy down the client certificates and keys to your local machine.

Step 8: Connecting to the VPN
Use OpenVPN on your local machine to connect to your VPN server:



    openvpn --config client.ovpn
